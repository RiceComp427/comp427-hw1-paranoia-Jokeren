## Rational Paranoia
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqifhp864b37ju).
This assignment is due **Thursday, January 17 at 6 p.m.**

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Keren Zhou

_Student NetID_: kz21

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: Documents
- Assumptions:
  - Some people want to steal their competitors' secret documents stored in the law firm.
  - An IT manager has all the rights to operate the IT system.
- Assets:
  - Important documents about sensitive legal, financial, or political matters.
- Threats:
  - People who want to steal the files by hacking into the law firm's IT system.
- Countermeasures:
  - Isolate the system in a place without an internet connection, which costs a substantial amount of money, as we need to build or rent the place. The solution is very safe because hackers can only invade our system through social engineering.
  - Distribute the system into several pieces and assign each part different passwords. The solution can be quickly implemented and has a little cost, but does not completely protect the system.
  - Give security department the right to enter the place, which costs only a small change, but it is highly probable that hackers can steal the tokens and pretend as security staffs.
  
## Problem 2
- Scenario: Grading
- Assumptions:
  - Some students may cheat.
  - Our anti-cheating system could effectively detect similar answers.
- Assets:
  - The fairness of homework grading, which protects students who finish homework by themselves and punishes those which cheat.
- Threats:
  - Students who cheat by exchanging answers or copying from the web.
- Countermeasures:
  - Use a system to calculate the similarities among students and manually check those with high similarities. We punish cheating students by letting them fail. Since we already have an anti-cheating system, the solution is both money saving and useful.
  
## Problem 3
- Scenario: When we park our cars in a public parking garage or an oil station, we need to prevent our assets in the vehicle from being stolen.
- Assumptions:
  - The public parking garage or oil station is not safe.
  - We have plenty of assets in the car.
- Assets:
  - Personal assets such as phones, laptops, credit cards, etc.
- Threats:
  - Thieves who have utilities to break into the car and grab assets.
- Countermeasures:
  - We can put large bags in the back trunk and bring phones and carry credit cards with us. The solution does not have any cost, while it is not safe at all if the thieves steal our keys or break our trunks.
  - We can upgrade car windows to be more hard and anti-theft, which is promising but requires some money.
